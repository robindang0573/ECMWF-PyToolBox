# ECMWF-PyToolBox

ECMWF toolbox created with python. Using this toolbox will able you to merge (join) serveral Netcdf4 with two diffrent methods,Convert Netcdf4 files to DHI MIKE ASCII (CF Convention)
and some idea and also guide for working with Netcdf4 files and Python.

## Summary
This package is built for gathering and process Marine and Weather data from ECMWF (https://www.ecmwf.int/) [The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts].

## Goals
  - Evaluate **`ERA5`** Model and making it more popular in Middle East
  - Guide new users of Python Api and Netcdf and giving them some realistic sample

* Package name: **`ECMWF PyToolBox`**
* Includes:
  * `ECMWF-ERA5-Area-Data-Extractor` Get ERA5 data for specific area in world
  * `ECMWF-Merging` Merge two or more Netcdf4 files and export a Netcdf4 with Python
  * `Netcdf4-to-DHI-Mike` Converts ECMWF netcdf data to CF Convention and raw text file that can be used for importing data to DHI Mike with Python
  * `Netcdf4-wrong-algorithms` Some wrong scripts for saving other developers time and prevent them making mistakes
